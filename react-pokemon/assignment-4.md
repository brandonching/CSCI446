# Assignment: Experimenting with JavaScript

## Overview

We're going to replicate what we did with the previous assignment, though, this time we're going to use React to do our DOM manipulation and state updates. This should make implementing the same web page much simpler.

You may find that you write more code in this project than with the previous one, but the hope is that the declarative nature of React makes it simpler to reason about what's happening.

For this assignment, we'll need to leverage the following topics we've covered in class:

- Basic React components JSX ([Your First Component tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/your-first-component))
- Controlled components ([Reacting to Input with State tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state))
- ```useState``` hooks!
- Component composition (i.e. passing props to child components, [passing props tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-props-to-a-component))

## Getting Started

In order to start this assignment, you should ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node (version > 18)
- npm (version > 5)

Once you have the tools installed, run the ```create-react-app``` script in your terminal or command line runner like so:

```
npx create-react-app@latest my-react-project
```

Where the last argument to the command (i.e. my-react-project) is the name of the project directory the script will create for you.

The script will download the app scaffolding and install your Node dependencies into the the project directory. From there, you can edit the code in the directory. You can see what scripts are available to run by looking at the ```package.json``` file.

For example, to run the application in your browser in development mode, you would run ```$ npm run start``` in your terminal or command line application.

## Criteria

For this assignment, there are no points for the static HTML because ```create-react-app``` provides a file for us and mounts our app into the ```#root``` element.

### CSS

- Display using flex and set a flex-wrap so that cards wrap on horizontal overflow(1)
- Set a flex-wrap so that Pokemon cards wrap on horizontal overflow (1)
- Assorted basic styling for the image and text (at least three additional style rules) (4)

### JavaScript/React

- One root component containing all other components (12)
  - This component should manage state (using the ```useState``` hook) to contain the Pokemon added via the form
  - This component should render the add form
  - This component should use the controlled components (manage this via a ```useState``` hook) for the form input values
  - The form's ```onSubmit``` method should fire the fetch request and add the new Pokemon to the component's state
  - This component should map over the Pokemon and send them via props to a component that renders each Pokemon card (use the ```key``` prop to avoid warnings in the dev tools with React)
- This component should have a method for replacing Pokemon with another (i.e. for the update function)
  - One component for rendering the Pokemon cards (5)
  - This component should accept a prop that is the Pokemon object returned from the API
  - This component should accept a prop to replace a Pokemon in the parent's state
  - This component should render a form to update the Pokemon card
  - The form's ```onSubmit``` should call the prop passed in to replace the Pokemon

### Writing

- Include a text file detailing your experiences with the previous assignment and this one. Discuss any challenges you faced, how you overcame them, and whether you preferred writing plain JavaScript or using React for fetching Pokemon from the API (5)
  - This should be about a half page in length

### Grading

Zip (```.zip``` file extension/format) up your ```create-react-app``` for grading (2)

### Hints

- Use the create-react-app scripts we discussed in class to get started
  - You'll need ```node``` and ```npm``` installed on your computer to use this
- Recall that the command is ```npx create-react-app@latest [project-name]```
- The default ```create-react-app``` directory structure is overkill for our needs, you may find that you only need ```App.js``` to contain all of your components
- You can simplify the create and update forms by extracting the shared logic into its own components
- You can pass functions down to child components via props and have them modify the parent component's state
- The demo video from [DOM Manipulation and Data Fetching with JavaScript](https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/64629/assignments/400579?wrap=1) should show you the expected functionality â€“ the only difference is we're using React instead of plain JavaScript!
- Recall that you should not mutate state in React but rather create new versions of it
  - Don't: ```setState(prevState => prevState.append(thing))```
  - Do: ```setState(prevState => [...prevState, thing])```
