# Assignment: Basic HTML & CSS

This assignment is to create a page with content of your choosing. Some ideas:

- An "About Me" page for a personal website
- A page about your pets
- A "Projects/Technologies" page documenting all the projects you've worked on or languages you're skilled with
- Anything else!

The following HTML elements should be present (point values in parenthesis):

1. One Header (1)
2. One Paragraph (1)
3. A list with at least three items (3)
   - Ordered or unordered, doesn't matter
4. A table with at least three rows of data, plus table headers (4)
5. A navigation bar (Using nav elements) (4)
   - The navigation bar should include at least three links; they don't need to actually go anywhere
6. At least two embedded images with alt tags (4)
7. At least one HTML entity (i.e. &copy;) (1)

The CSS should:

- Be in a separate file and linked to in the HTML page (assume the files are next to each other on the filesystem) (1)
- The table should have a border, and the header should be styled differently from the table data (4)
