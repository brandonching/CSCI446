      <h2>Explore the Texas Experience</h2>

      <p>
        Texas, the second-largest state in the United States, boasts a
        captivating tapestry of diverse cultures, a storied history that unfolds
        across centuries, and sweeping landscapes that stretch as far as the eye
        can see. The cultural mosaic of Texas is a dynamic blend of influences,
        from the deep roots of its indigenous peoples to the vibrant
        contributions of Spanish, Mexican, and European settlers. This
        amalgamation has given rise to a state where traditions are celebrated
        with pride, where rodeos and barbecue festivals echo the spirit of the
        Wild West, and where modern urban centers pulse with the energy of
        innovation and multiculturalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The history of Texas is a narrative etched in time, marked by tales of
        Spanish explorers, missions, and the struggle for independence. The
        echoes of the Battle of the Alamo and the iconic figures like Sam
        Houston resonate through the annals of Texan history, creating a sense
        of pride and identity among its residents. From the days of the Republic
        of Texas to its eventual annexation into the United States, each chapter
        contributes to the unique character of the Lone Star State.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond its cultural and historical richness, Texas unveils landscapes
        that paint a breathtaking tableau. The vast expanses of deserts, rolling
        hills, dense forests, and coastal plains create a visual symphony that
        encapsulates the essence of the state's geographic diversity. The
        sunsets over the Gulf of Mexico, the rugged beauty of Big Bend National
        Park, and the sprawling urban skylines stand as testaments to the sheer
        variety of Texas's natural wonders.
      </p>
      <p>
        In every corner of Texas, from the bustling metropolises of Houston and
        Dallas to the serene countryside, there's an undeniable sense of pride
        in being a Texan. It's a state where hospitality is as vast as its
        horizons, where traditions are passed down through generations, and
        where the spirit of independence and resilience continues to shape its
        ever-evolving narrative.

      <h3>Six Flags over Texas</h3>
      <p>
        The Six Flags over Texas are the six flags that have flown over the U.S.
        state of Texas since 1519, when Alonso Álvarez de Pineda claimed Texas
        in the name of the Spanish Empire. The flags are the emblems of Spain
        (1519–1685; 1690–1821), France (1685–1690), Mexico (1821–1836), the
        Republic of Texas (1836–1845), the Confederate States of America
        (1861–1865), and the United States of America (1845–1861; 1865–present
        day).
      </p>

      <h4>Spain (1519–1685; 1690–1821)</h4>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <img class="flag" src="images/Flag_of_Spain.png" alt="Flag of Spain" />
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            The first flag belonged to Spain, which ruled most of Texas from
            1519 to 1685 and 1690 to 1821. Spain was the first European country
            to claim and control the area of Texas. The first mission
            established in Texas was Corpus Christi de la Ysleta, founded in
            1682 by Franciscan friars serving at the Jesuit missions in northern
            Mexico. In 1684, Spanish explorer Juan Domínguez de Mendoza
            established the first Spanish fortification in Texas, Presidio San
            Juan Bautista, on the Rio Grande near modern Eagle Pass. The new
            fort was named in honor of the mission that Mendoza had established
            nearby, San Juan Bautista. In 1689, Spanish explorer Alonso de León,
            who had been searching for the French settlement La Salle founded in
            1685, crossed into Texas from Mexico and rediscovered the ruins of
            the French fort. He buried a lead plate inscribed with the royal
            arms of France and Spain at the site, claiming the territory for his
            king and country. The Spanish village of Nacogdoches was founded on
            the site of the French settlement in 1779. In 1803, the Louisiana
            Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the United States into control
            of the Texas claim by right of its purchase of the French claim on
            the continent.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>France (1685–1690)</h4>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <img
          class="flag"
          src="images/Flag_of_France.png"
          alt="Flag of France"
        />

        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            The second flag belonged to France, which ruled most of Texas from
            1685 to 1690. France was in control of the territory from 1685 to
            1690, after the French admiral Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de
            Bienville claimed the territory as French in 1685. The French
            founded the short lived Fort Saint Louis in 1685 as part of La
            Salle's colony. The colony was killed off by Native Americans after
            three years of occupation. In 1690, Spanish authorities, led by
            Alonso de León, found the French colony in ruins and buried the
            remains of the fort's dead defenders, planting a cross over the
            grave and claiming the territory for Spain.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>Mexico (1821–1836)</h4>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <img
          class="flag"
          src="images/Flag_of_Mexico.png"

        />

        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            The third flag belonged to Mexico, which ruled Texas from 1821 to
            1836. Mexico was in control of the territory from 1821 until 1836
            after the Mexican War of Independence. Mexico had become an
            independent nation in 1821, after gaining its independence from
            Spain. Mexico was in control of the territory of Texas until 1836
            when Texas gained independence from Mexico.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>Republic of Texas (1836–1845)</h4>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <img class="flag" src="images/Flag_of_Texas.png" alt="Flag of Texas" />

        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            The fourth flag belonged to the Republic of Texas from 1836 to 1845.
            Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1836. The Republic of
            Texas was formed and its flag was first raised on March 2, 1836. The
            Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States on December 29,
            1845, after Texas voters approved annexation in a statewide
            referendum.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>Confederate States of America (1861–1865)</h4>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <img
          src="images/Flag_of_the_Confederate_States.png"
          alt="Flag of the Confederate States of America"
        />
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            The fifth flag belonged to the Confederate States of America from
            1861 to 1865. Texas seceded from the United States in 1861 and
            joined the Confederate States of America. The Confederate States of
            America was defeated in 1865 and the United States was restored.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>United States of America (1845–1861; 1865–present day)</h4>
      <div class="grid-container">

        />
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            The sixth and current flag was adopted by the state legislature on
            August 31, 1933, and approved by Texas voters in a referendum on
            September 5, 1933. The six flags are also shown on the reverse of
            the Seal of Texas.
