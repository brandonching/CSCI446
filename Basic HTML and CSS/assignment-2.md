# Assignment: CSS Layout

## Description

We're going to lay a page out using Flexbox and Grid. With whatever content of your choosing, we're going to build a basic grid layout and use flexbox to arrange our content on that page.

This assignment focuses more on CSS than on HTML (compared to the previous assignment). Please do not use CSS frameworks for this one. You must write your own CSS (targeting classes, ids, or elements, respectively).
